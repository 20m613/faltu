1:debt to equity ratio (Lower the better, company's balance sheet)
  debt->  Company sells the debt instruments to the investor with the promise that the money invested + the interest will be returned back to the investor at the time of crisis.
		  Debt financing occurs when a firm sells fixed income products, such as bonds, bills, or notes, to investors to obtain the capital needed to grow and expand its operations. 
		  When a company issues a bond, the investors that purchase the bond are lenders who are either retail or institutional investors that provide the company with debt financing. 
		  The amount of the investment loan, referred to as the principal, must be paid back at some agreed date in the future. 
		  If the company goes bankrupt, lenders have a higher claim on any liquidated assets than shareholders. 

  equity=asset(Total real Value of the business)- liabilities(outstanding debt)
  (Shares)--> one's onwership in the asset after all the debts are paid off.
			  It gives the shareholder a claim on future earnings, but it does not need to be paid back.
			  If the company goes bankrupt, equity holders are the last in line to receive money
 
  
2:CAGR-->	Compound annual growth rate
			CAGR=(EV/BV)^(1/n)-1
			where
				EV = Investment's ending value
				BV = Investment's beginning value
				n   = Number of periods (months, years, etc.)
